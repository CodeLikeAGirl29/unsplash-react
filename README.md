## API Reference

The official docs on Unsplash can be found [here](https://unsplash.com/documentation)

In order to use this with my site, I created an ```.env``` file, and then ```VITE_API_KEY=<API KEY HERE>``` and per Vite's requirement, in ```App.jsx``` where needed, the code is ``` import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY```

### Using React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
